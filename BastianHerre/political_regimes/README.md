# Code and datasets on political regimes

This repository contains the code written and datasets created for my projects at Our World In Data which use data on political regimes.


The data are used in the following posts:
- [200 years ago, everyone lacked democratic rights. Now, more than a billion people have them.](https://ourworldindata.org/democratic-rights)
- [The ‘Regimes of the World’ data: how do researchers identify which countries are democracies?](https://ourworldindata.org/regimes-of-the-world-data)
- [In most countries, democracy is a recent achievement. Dictatorship is far from a distant memory](https://ourworldindata.org/democracies-age)
