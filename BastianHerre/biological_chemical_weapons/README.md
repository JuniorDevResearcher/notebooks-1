# Scripts and datasets on democracy

This repository contains the script written and dataset created for my projects at Our World In Data which use data on biological and chemical weapons.

The repository includes the script that cleans the datasets, and refines and aggregates some variables.

The repository also includes the final version of the dataset and the sources for its coding.

Finally, the repository includes the metadata of the final version of the dataset, comprising of variable names and variable labels.

The data are used in Our World in Data's page on [Biological and Chemical Weapons](https://ourworldindata.org/biological-chemical-weapons).
