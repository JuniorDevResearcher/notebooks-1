# Scripts and datasets on democracy

This repository contains the scripts written and datasets created for my projects at Our World In Data which use data on nuclear weapons.

The repository includes the scripts that clean the datasets, and refine and aggregate some variables.

The repository also includes the final versions of the datasets.

Finally, the repository includes the metadata of the final versions of the datasets, comprising of variable names and variable labels.

The data are used in Our World in Data's page on [Nuclear Weapons](https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons).
