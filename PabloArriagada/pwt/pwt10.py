# # Penn World Table dataset

# The Penn World Table allows for cross-country comparisons of real GDP across time, making use of prices collected in multiple benckmark years by the International Comparisons Program (ICP) to construct purchasing-power-parity (PPP) exchange rates. The most recent version (10.0) contains information for 183 countries and regions from 1950 to 2019 (when it can be estimated).

# ### Based on prices that are constant across countries and over time

# **Expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs (2017US$)**
# <br>
# *rgdpe*
# <br>
# It measures living standards across countries and across years using prices for final goods that are constant across countries and over time. This variable is multiplied by 1,000,000 to get the measure in 2017 USD instead of millions of USD.

# <br>
# *rgdpo*
# <br>
# It measures productive capacity across countries and across years using prices for final goods, exports and imports that are constant across countries and over time. This variable is multiplied by 1,000,000 to get the measure in 2017 USD instead of millions of USD.

# ### Transformations
# Using as a reference the document [(1)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kg9ZqxXXfDWA7WxfDysB0GjwlQ6kK5x6kNP-m7Sjl-I/edit?pli=1#), the following transformations to PWT 10.0 are done to match the OWID structure in Grapher.
# The transformation of many variables consists in multiplying them by 1,000,000 to change their units from "million USD" to just "USD". It is the case for:
#
# - **Expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs**, `rgdpe`
# - **Output-side real GDP at chained PPPs**, `rgdpo`
# - **Real consumption of households and government at current PPPs**, `ccon`
# - **Real domestic absorption at current PPPs**, `cda`
# - **Expenditure-side real GDP at current PPPs**, `cgdpe`
# - **Output-side real GDP at current PPPs**, `cgdpo`
# - **Capital stock at current PPPs**, `cn`
# - **Real GDP at constant 2011 national prices**, `rgdpna`
# - **Real consumption at constant 2011 national prices**, `rconna`
# - **Real domestic absorption at constant 2011 national prices**, `rdana`
# - **Capital stock at constant 2011 national prices**, `rnna`
#
# Two variables are multiplied by 1,000,000 to express their units in "people" instead of "million people"
#
# - **Population**, `pop`
# - **Number of persons engaged**, `emp`
#
# The variable `productivity` is estimated as the **total real output-side GDP per hour worked**; it is then `rgdpo` divided by the average hours worked per persons engaged (`avh`) and the total number of persons engaged (`emp`)
#
# Two real GDP per capita measures are also calculated:
# - **Output-side real GDP per capita** (`gdppc_o`), as the total output-side real GDP `rgdpo` divided by the population `pop`
# - **Expenditure-side real GDP per capita** (`gdppc_e`) , as the total expenditure-side real GDP `rgdpe` divided by the population `pop`

But the most dramatic case is the one for **Venezuela (2017)**, which sees its value virtually destroyed by the reestimation: it is now 5% of the value from v9.1 (x0.05).

# ## Appendix

# ### The changes in PWT 10.0
# According to [(2)](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/docs/pwt100-user-guide-to-data-files.pdf), in its variables and their construction, version 10 **"closely resembles PWT versions 8.0, 8.1, 9.0
# and 9.1"**. The changes from 9.1 to 10 include **"new relative price data, extended and revised
# national accounts data, revisions to how we estimate employment data and a modification to the methodology for estimating investment by asset"**.
#
# According to [(3)](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/docs/pwt100-whatsnew.pdf), comparing with the 8.0 version (the last big change in the dataset) **"the main structure of the database and definition of its variables are unchanged in PWT 10.0"**. The changes fall in four broad categories:
# 1. *The incorporation of new purchasing power parities (PPPs) data for most countries for the years 2011 to 2017*
#     
#     PWT 10.0 adds revised ICP benchmarks for 2011, new benchmarks for 2017 and interpolated benchmarks for 2012-2016. Price levels for the expenditure categories are revised substantially. v9.1 interpolated the 2011 ICP benchmark for 2017 and for v10 they rely on direct ICP benchmark for nearly all countries, also replacing 2014 OECD and 2011-2017 Eurostat benchmarks. All of these changes lead to a higher dispersion in the differences. For years between the 2011 and 2017 ICP benchmarks, they rely on interpolations by the World Bank. Corrections to the GDP expenditure composition also result in additional adjustments clearer than household consumption in 2017.
#     
#     With the incorporation of the 2017 ICP data, the reference year has changed from 2011 in v9.0 and 9.1 to 2017 in v10.
#     
#     
# 2. *The incorporation of revised and extended National Accounts data, covering the period up to 2019*
#
#     (1) mainly affects price levels, the new National Accounts data mainly affects nominal GDP levels and real growth rates. These revisions are commonly observed for African nations, but also in Latin America, the Caribban and Middle East (Paraguay, Niger and Djibouti are highlighted. It is mentioned in the document that these revisions are both welcome and alarming, because they reflect the effort made the national agencies, but also underscore the uncertainty about the true size of some economies.
#     
#     
# 3. *Revisions to how we estimate employment data, in particular for low and middle-income countries*
#     
#     v10.0 makes substantial changes to the source data for employment, modifies the link procedure used to combine the employment estimate from different sources. They incorporated more up-to-date information and evaluated the comparability of sources, which leads to the improved the estimates for a few dozen African, South/South-East Asian and Latin American countries. Revisions to the employment data in their original sources also alter the estimates for some countries, especially for more recent years. More details about the use of sources in pages 5 and 6.
#     
#     
# 4. *A modification to the methodology for estimating investment by asset*
#
#     They adjusted the linking between National Account statistics dereived from the Total Economy Database and estimates using the Commodity-flow method (CFM). Argentina is shown as one of the more severe revisions, but in general the impact is for about 30 countries.

# Other changes are:
# - They replaced the exchange rate [xr] for Sudan for the years 1970 to 2019 with estimates from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. This predominantly affects the Sudanese level of real GDP at current PPPs, and variables depending on these estimates (i.e. [ctfp]).
# - They replaced the ICP benchmarks for the years 1996 and 2005 with benchmarks from Eurostat and the OECD whenever available. This resolved spikes in price levels for several European countries (notably GBR) and revised growth rates of price levels between 1985 and 1996 for several OECD countries.
# - They updated PWT 10.0 due to an error in the current value of GDP [v_gdp] for their alternative time-series of China. Note that the variables relying on current GDP (e.g. [cgdpo], [rgdpo], etc.) as well as the reported price levels, were also affected by this revision for CHN.
# - New TFP estimates: New employment and investment data has allowed them to extend TFP estimates for several countries: BWA, IDN, MUS, NAM, UZB, ZMB.
# - New output/expenditure estimates: A new 2017 PPP benchmark for GUY allowed them to include this country in PWT 10.0.
# - Update human capital [hc]: update from Barro and Lee v. 2.0 to 2.2. Revisions for CHN and DOM.
# - Revision capital services [rkna]: fixed an issue in PWT 9.1, where the implied capital compensation ([k] / [ucc]) did not always equal (1-[labsh]) * [gdp]. This fix solves several breaks in [rkna], most notably for CZE, LVA, ROU and RUS.
# - Revision price level capital stocks [pl_n]: fixed an issue in PWT 9.1, where the price level for capital stocks was always equal to the price level for GDP [pl_gdpo] for the USA. The price level for the USA is now estimated using asset-specific PPPs weighted by nominal capital stocks. It is set to 1 for the USA in the base year 2017.
# - Outliers price levels. They have identified a number of new outliers in the price levels for GDP and Domestic Absorption (DA). They used the criteria discussed at length in the document “Outliers in PWT8.0”, available on the PWT website. In short, price levels for [cgdpo] and [cda] are marked an outlier if the price level is extrapolated from the first or last available benchmark and the observed level exceeds the bounds of a predicted level, based on an OLS regression of the log of GDP per capita and the log price level of GDP and DA respectively. New outliers were identified for one or more years for ABW, ALB, ARM, ATG, BGR, BLR, CYM, IRQ, OMN, SDN, SXM, TGO, TJK, VEN. Some of the outliers identified in PWT 9.0 and 9.1 were no longer identified as such. Consult the [i_outlier] variable for further details.

# ### The variables of PWT
# In the documents [(2)](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/docs/pwt100-user-guide-to-data-files.pdf) and [(3)](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/docs/pwt100-whatsnew.pdf) is recommended to check the document [(4)](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/related-research-papers/the_next_generation_of_the_penn_world_table.pdf) to see the variables that are published in the Penn World Tables. Although this paper refers to v8.1, there has not been major changes to the list. You can find below the list of key variables of PWT:

# ![PWT%20variables%202.jpg](attachment:PWT%20variables%202.jpg)

# ### Exploratory Data Analysis
#
# Although in the documents it is stated that both versions 9.1 and 10 are virtually the same in terms of the list of variables, it is necessary to check this with the actual datasets

# +
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px

#Loading PWT 9.1
pwt9_path = Path('data/pwt91.xlsx')
pwt9 = pd.read_excel(pwt9_path,sheet_name='Data')
pwt9
# -

#Loading PWT 10.0
pwt10_path = Path('data/pwt100.xlsx')
pwt10 = pd.read_excel(pwt10_path,sheet_name='Data')
pwt10

# They have the same number of columns and the number of rows in PWT 10.0 is larger than in PWT 9.1, which is a good sign to think they have the same variables with new data for countries and years in PWT 10.0.
#
# This is obviously not enough, so I get a list of the variables from both datasets

list_pwt9 = list(pwt9)
list_pwt9

list_pwt10 = list(pwt10)
list_pwt10

# These two lists can be compared by using the `==` operator: 

list_pwt9 == list_pwt10

# The equality is true so it can be said that both datasets have the same variables and with the same order. If the result was false it would be necessary to order them first to confirm the equality:

list_pwt9_ordered = list_pwt9.sort()
list_pwt10_ordered = list_pwt10.sort()
list_pwt9_ordered == list_pwt10_ordered

# A join of both dataset is generated for a quick comparison between their variables

pwt9['version'] = "9.1"
pwt10['version'] = "10.0"
#pwt9_10 = pwt9.append(pwt10, ignore_index=True)
pwt9_10 = pd.concat([pwt9, pwt10], ignore_index=True)

# The `seaborn` library allows to plot pairwise relations in a dataset:

# - [pairplot documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html)
# - [PairGrid documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.PairGrid.html#seaborn.PairGrid)

# For instance, this way the differences in real and constant GDP each year can be plotted:

# +
#sns.pairplot(pwt9_10, x_vars='year',y_vars=['rgdpe','rgdpo', 'cgdpe', 'cgdpo'], 
#             hue = "version", height=5, aspect=3, kind="scatter", dropna=True)
# -

# The rest of the variables can also be plotted against `year`:

# +
#sns.pairplot(pwt9_10, x_vars='year', hue = "version", height=5, aspect=3)
# -

# It is clear that most variables change and not only for the most recent years, but for the entire time frame. The variables that don't change (much) are:
# - pop
# - emp
# - hc
# - xr (with outlier)
# - statcap
