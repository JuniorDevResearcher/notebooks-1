A global dataset of poverty and inequality measures prepared by Our World in Data from the World Bankâ€™s Poverty and Inequality Platform database.



This download contains three subfolders:

inc_only: This contains observations from PIP that relate to income surveys only. 

cons_only: This contains observations from PIP that relate to expenditure surveys only.

inc_or_cons: This contains observations from PIP that relate to either income or expenditure surveys. For years in which both an income and expenditure survey is present in PIP, the income data is dropped. This means that there is never more than one observation per year per country.

Each folder contains a csv file of the prepared data and a codebook giving a brief description of each variable within the data file.
