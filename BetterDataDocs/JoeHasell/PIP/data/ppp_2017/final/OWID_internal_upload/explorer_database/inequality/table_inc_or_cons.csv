Share of the richest decile in total income or expenditure,decile10_share,World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform,The income or expenditure of the richest decile (tenth of the population) as a share of total income or expenditure.,https://pip.worldbank.org/,World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP),%,%,5.0,Numeric,0.0,0;5;10;15;20;25;30;35;40;45;50,'true,Greens
P90/P10 ratio,p90_p10_ratio,World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform,P90 is the the level of income or expenditure below which 90% of the population lives. P10 is the level of income or expenditure below which 10% of the population lives. This variable gives the ratio of the two. It is a measure of inequality that indicates the gap between the richest and poorest tenth of the population. It tells you how many times richer someone just in the the poorest tenth would need to be in order to be counted in the richest tenth.,https://pip.worldbank.org/,"World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP), adapted by Our World in Data.",,,5.0,Numeric,0.0,0;2;4;6;8;10;12;14;16;18,'true,OrRd
P90/P50 ratio,p90_p50_ratio,World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform,P90 is the the level of income or expenditure above which 10% of the population lives. P50 is the median – the level of income or expenditure below which 50% of the population lives. This variable gives the ratio of the two. It is a measure of inequality within the top half of the distribution. It tells you how many times richer someone in the middle of the distribution would need to be in order to be counted in the richest tenth.,https://pip.worldbank.org/,"World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP), adapted by Our World in Data.",,,5.0,Numeric,0.0,0;2;4;6;8;10;12;14;16;18,'true,Purples

P10 is the the level of income or expenditure below which 10% of the population lives. This variable gives the ratio of the two. It is a measure of inequality within the bottom half of the distribution.

Mean Log Deviation,mld,World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform,"The mean log deviation (MLD) is a measure of inequality. An MLD of zero indicates perfect equality and it takes on larger positive values as incomes become more unequal. The measure is also referred to as 'Theil L' or 'GE(0)', in reference to the wider families of inequality measures to which the MLD belongs.",https://pip.worldbank.org/,World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP),,,5.0,Numeric,0.0,0;2;4;6;8;10;12;14;16;18,'true,RdPu
Polarization index,polarization,World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform,"The polarization index, also known as the Wolfson polarization index, measures the extent to which the distribution of income or expenditure is “spread out” and bi-modal. Like the Gini coefficient, the polarization index ranges from 0 (no polarization) to 1 (complete polarization). The polarization index is based on Wolfson (1994) and Ravallion and Chen (1997). See Wolfson, Michael C. 1994. “When Inequalities Diverge.” The American Economic Review 84 (2): 353–58. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117858 and Ravallion, Martin, and Shaohua Chen. 1997. “What Can New Survey Data Tell Us about Recent Changes in Distribution and Poverty?” The World Bank Economic Review 11 (2): 357–82. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3990232.",https://pip.worldbank.org/,World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP),,,5.0,Numeric,0.0,0;2;4;6;8;10;12;14;16;18,'true,Reds
