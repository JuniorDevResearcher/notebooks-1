The Indonesian Military aggressively hunts, cracks down, imprison, and dishonorably discharge LGBTQIA+ identifying members of the Indonesian Military. Back then, the Indonesian Psychological Association stated that LGBTQIA+ identity is a mental illness. Numerous people inside the Military were imprisoned if vigilantes caught Military members having private, consensual, gay sex. <br />

We compiled and translated the tweets from the Indonesian Air Force’s Official Account responding to questions about recruiting LGBTQIA+ identifying people to the Indonesian Military. Here are all the tweets in chronological order:<br />
<br />
1. When being asked if members of the LGBTQIA+ community can serve in the Indonesian Military, here are their response: (https://twitter.com/_TNIAU/status/950706476623933446) <br />
Ooohhh, cannot<br />
<br />
Upon selection there are psychological tests, LGBT is a mental disorder If there are many recruits that are mentally healthy why must we accept the mentally deficient?<br />
<br />
2. The twitter went viral and there were some criticisms, which they responded with: (https://twitter.com/_TNIAU/status/950723833606037505)<br />
(The word “normal” means heterosexual)<br />
Responding to many mentions that went in -> until right now there are still many Military recruits that have a normal sexual orientation. <br />
<br />
Members of the Indonesian Military are governed by military norms including religious norms & laws, so (members) must be physically & mentally healthy<br />
<br />
3. In response to the numerous tweets arguing that homosexuality is not a mental illness, they responded with: (https://twitter.com/_TNIAU/status/950733029894381569)<br />
(“Airmin” is how they say Air Force Admin)<br />
(“UI” is short for the University of Indonesia, the top University in Indonesia)<br />

4. One person replied that it is an opinion of one person and does not equate the scientific burden of proof. They responded with: (https://twitter.com/_TNIAU/status/950737066127536128)<br />
As an member of the Military who is pious to the Almighty God and as a Muslim the Al-Quran is enough to be a scientific proof, are there any higher knowledge and more credible than the Holy Bible? In the Holy Bible LGBT is not only prohibited but also “cursed”<br />
