# # Checking data availability for countries

# This notebook is to analyse in detail the availability of data for each country in Penn World Table 10.0, as not all countries cover the entire 1950-2019 range.

# When plotting the number of observations (i.e. countries) against years for each variable available in PWT we can see the jumps in coverage. For example, for the GDP variables, in 1950 there are over 50 countries covered, in 1960 they are over 100 and in 1970 the number is 157. The last big jump is in 1990 to reach 181 countries to get 183 between 2005 and 2019. For some other variables the number of countries available is a smaller quantity, it is important to have in mind this when aggregating regional data especially in previous decades.

fig = px.line(df_all_year, x="year", y="value", color="variable", height=600,
              title='<b>Country coverage in PWT</b>',
             labels={

# How is this availability shown by country? In this graph the countries are in ascending order of the number of observations available. For instance, the entities with the lowest number of years available (for `rgdpe`) are Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten (Dutch part), incorporated in 2005. They are followed by the countries included from 1990 onwards, mostly former Soviet republics, the nations that formed Yugoslavia, Czechia and Slovakia. The countries incorporated from 1970 onwards are more varied, including Caribbean countries as Antigua and Barbuda or Bahamas and several Asian countries, like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Laos or Mongolia. The 1960 batch is mostly from Africa (Botswana, Cameroon, Mozambique, Senegal...). The countries that cover the entire timeframe of PWT are most of the advanced economies of Europe and North America, several South American countries and Australia and New Zealand.

# Please note that the range is mostly continous after each country is included, but there are exceptions, like in `cgdpo` in the case of Bermuda, unavailable for 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2003.

# PWT also includes data quality variables which are not necessarily applied uniformly between countries. See for example `i_cig`, the variable referring to the quality of the relative price data for consumption, investment and government. Each point in the scatter plot is one country-year: some quality categories are evenly distributed (as *ICP PPP timeseries...*, the vintages for the PPP), but some others are assigned differently (double-click in *Benchmark*).

df['i_cig'] = df['i_cig'].astype(str)

#Change the log_x and log_y parameters to "False" to see negative values
